# My Personal Project - Taiwan Journey Planner

## Project Introduction  

This application will apply a personalize unforgettable trip for visiters. I aim to design an application to help visitors generate the best places, restaurants, and landmarks they should visit when *visiting different cities in Taiwan*. As a Taiwanese, I hope tourists from other countries can be happy and enjoy themselves when visiting my hometown. Therefore, to help every visitor have the best journey and memories in Taiwan (South Taiwan), **the recommendations will be provided based on the tourist's background** (age, number of people, type of locationsâ€¦..etc). This app will include famous landmarks, and also places that I recommanded (which will be different from what the internet usually recommanded).

This app is specified for people visiting or planning to visit Taiwan (South Taiwan). The tourist will need to **input** some information when using the application to help specify its need. The system will not recommand places it already recommand before. In addition, the user can also choose to input locations that already visit before generating a new location. In the end of the trip, the user will provide feeded back for this application. The following are some example input. :
- Cities in Taiwan , only south Taiwan(Taipei, New Taipei, Keelong......)
- Type of locations (Restaurant, Landmarks, Shopping Center......)
- Estimated spending (per person)

I hope to introduce my hometown to more people and encourage more foreigners to visit and enjoy a *wonderful vacation in Taiwan*.
